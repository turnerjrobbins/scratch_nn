The goal of this project is to design a neural network from scratch and to use
said NN to perform some sort of classification.

Neural Networks are composed of a series of connected layers. The first layer 
is known as the 'input layer' and has one artificial neuron for each input. 

All of the input neurons recieve an unfiltered signal from the input, and 
process that signal using an activation function (for example the sigmoid
function or identity function) to produce an output.

In a fully-connected neural network each input neuron is connected to all of
the neurons in the next layer so that the input for one neuron in layer two is
the sum of all of the outputs from layer one (with each output being 
multiplied by a weight).
